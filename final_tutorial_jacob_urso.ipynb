    "I have grouped together these two steps because they happen at roughly the same time. First I create an empty list that will be populated with dataframes for each month of data that is collected. I include the code snippet header=0 in the pandas function to ensure the column titles will not be read in as a datapoint. The next step is to tidy the data by fixing the location column. For some reason the location column was read in as a separate data point so I copy the location to the above data and then delete all of the nan rows. Lastly, reindex and display the head.\n",

By altering the location variables earlier I have ensured that all the requests will return with a 200 status message and load the response using a json object into the proper columns of the data frame.\n",

    "Takeaways from visualization\n",
    "Heatmap(Total): This showed me that the assaults clustered in two main locations on campus. Specifically, the clusters were around freshman and sophomore living spaces.\n",
    "Bar Graphs: The bar graphs showed me two things, the first of which is that the months that marked the beginning of a semester had higher levels of sexual assault in comparison to the months surrounding them, and the second was that sexual assault has been increasing in frequency in recent years\n",
    "Heatmap(Month): These graphs showed me that in the months that I mentioned earlier that mark the beginning of the semester, sexual assault locations become even more concentrated in freshmen dorms as the average latitude shifts towards the freshmen communities\n",
    "Violin Plot: Lastly the violin plot confirmed the notion that sexual assault makes its way north on campus in the early months of the semester as seen in the lack of skew compared to other months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis and ML\n",
    "For this portion of the project I will be looking at the impact that year has had on sexual assault. In other words I will be attempting to answer the questions:\n",
    "Is sexual assault frequency increasing or decreasing?\n",
    "At what rate?\n",
    "Can it be modeled?\n",
    "And to move into the last section... what can be done?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to analysis was to manipulate the data a little bit further to make the regressions easier to code. After, the arrays are then reshaped and a linear regression is done using sklearn to output a line of best fit onto the plot. \n",

    "-Sexual Assault is happening more frequently in regions of campus with more underclassmen at the beginning of the semester\n",

    "Administration should consider arming incoming freshmen with more knowledge to try to deal with the first point. Perhaps more required courses related to consent assault should exist. The other takeaway to help continue the trend of dealing with this problem is to continue with programs that have been used in recent years and improve upon them.\n",

    "Unfortunately, the dataset lacked more details such as gender, age, and other personal information which would have made more digging possible. This program aimed to fully display available sexual assault statistics in the college park area and educate policy makers on how to better these statistics. \n"
